- [ ] Step 12: Add Session Management with Tests
- [ ] Step 13: Implement Loading States with Tests
- [ ] Step 14: Add Error Handling UI with Tests
- [ ] Step 15: Optimize Performance with Tests

## Phase 4: E2E Testing (Not Started)
- [ ] Step 16: Complete E2E Testing Suite

## TDD Principles
- Write tests FIRST before implementation
- Each step must integrate with previous work
- No orphaned code allowed
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- All tests must pass before moving to next step

## Notes
- Follow TDD strictly - RED, GREEN, REFACTOR cycle
- Test on real Android device after each phase
- Keep commits atomic with descriptive messages
- Update metrics after each step

## Next Action
Start with Step 7: Build Input Component with TDD
